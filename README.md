# ImageFusion
<p> Combining two medical images for improvement image quality

<br> This program perform next stages:

1.	Open and correctly cut in Matlab two images (image.ct and image.pet), which was measured by different way, of the same patient;
2.	Normalize this two images by size and type;
3.	Normalize the images by orientation in space by using control points;
4.	Fuse the images in different way:
	Fuse the images by using weigh coefficients;
	Fuse the images by using adaptive weigh coefficients;
	Fuse the images by using adaptive weigh coefficients for their separate parts;
	
5.	Evaluate the performance of obtained images by using mathematical tools;
